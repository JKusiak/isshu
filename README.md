This project is being developed to create an application for managing IT projects and tracking issues during software development. The motivation behind it is purely educational, I wanted to get accustomed with bigger scale projects and the MERN stack. There is still a lot to be done, as I'm learning a lot of things on the way, and have to rewrite chunks of code in the process.

## Technologies used:

### Backend:
- Javascript
- NodeJS
- ExpressJS
- MongoDB and Mongoose
`
### Frontend:
- Typescript
- Axios
- React-Router
- Material-UI

### Testing:
- Jest and Enzyme
- Nightwatch

## To do:
- [ ] testing
- [ ] eliminating code redundancy
- [ ] uploading images
- [ ] middleware for cascade delete
